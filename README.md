# Meet Decor
Hack The Mountains Hackathon Project

# Aim
Meet Decor is a Solo Project that is envisioned to bring a new and engaging classroom experience. It has a developed Meet Arena where students can join and learn. Here students are continuously AI monitored and given attendance based on their presence. You can also stream your virtual board. It has quite a few colors to pick from. This helps the visual part of understanding easier. 

# What's next from here
- Well, the meet arena is not fully functional. That is something that needs to figured out. 
- Also, the GUI of the Meet Arena is not quite good. Along with that features like chat, common ground to upload materials and cloud storage for recording and others.
- Chat includes Live Classroom Chat, Person to Person, Person to Group and Faculty to Student
- Another AI monitor to check the mood of the students. This can help the teachers to liven up the session when the count drops.
- Backend literally plays a vital role. Student data and faculty data along with their IDs must be stored. By this way, exclusive access can be given to students and faculties.
